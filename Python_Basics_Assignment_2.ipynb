    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False. For Eg , 2 > 1 will return boolean True and 1 > 2 will return boolean False.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans - The three different types of boolean operators are :\n",
    "    \n",
    "      and - This returns True only if all the inputs are True. If any one of the inputs is False then it will return False.\n",

    "      or - This returns True if any of the inputs is True.\n",
    "    \n",

    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",

    "      if block will be executed when the value of spam is greater than 5. It will go the third block, which is the else part of\n",
    "      the 2nd if block. It will be executed when the value is not greater than 5. In this example , the 3rd block will be \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans - Ctrl + C\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Break statement stops the iteration of the current loop containing it and the flow goes to the statement outside the loop\n",
    "      whereas continue statement skip the execution of the statements mentioned below continue and move to the next iteration\n",
    "      within the same loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans-  All 3 produces the same result. The range operator takes three parameter - range (start, stop, step) \n",
    "      Start and Step are optional and takes the value 0 and 1 respectively. So all the 3 cases it will consider 0 till 9.\n",
