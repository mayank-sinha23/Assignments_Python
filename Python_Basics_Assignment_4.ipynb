    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Lists are represented as [] in Python. [] denotes an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? \n",
    "\n",
    "(Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - spam[2] = 'hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The value will be 'd'. It will search for spam[3] i.e 4th item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The value will be 'd'. Last item present in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The value will be ['a','b'].\n",

    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The value will be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The list will become [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The list will become [3.14, 11,'cat,' True]. It will remove the first occurence of 'cat'.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - List concatenation operator is + . Eg , listA = [1,2] ,list B = [3, 4]. list A + list B will be [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "      List Replication Operator is *. Eg , listA = [1,2]. list A * 2 will be [1,2,1,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Append method will add the item to the end of the list whereas Insert method can be used to insert an item at a \n",
    "\n",
    "      specific index of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The two methods for removing items from a list are pop() and remove().\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Both lists ans strings are ordered and can be accessed using the indices. Indexing and Slicing operations can be\n",
    "\n",
    "      applied to both lists and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Lists are mutable (i.e can be modified) whereas Tuples are immutable( i.e cannot be modified). Tuples consumes less memory\n",
    "\n",
    "     as compared to lists as they are stored in single block of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - a = (42,). \n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - List can be converted to tuple and tuples can be converted to list by typecasting.tuple() and list() function can be\n",
    "\n",
    "      used.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Eg. list1 = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "          \n",
    "          tuple1 = tuple(list1)\n",
    "            \n",
    "      Eg. tuple2 = (1,2,3,4)\n",
    "          \n",
    "          list2 = list(tuple2) \n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - They contain references to the values present in the lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - copy.copy , also known as shallow copy creates a copied object with references to the objects in the original object \n",
    "\n",
    "      which is copied. Modifying the copied object do change the original copy as well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      copy.deepcopy creates a new object which copies the main object recursively. Modifying the copied object will not \n",
    "        \n",
    "      change the original copy.  \n",
